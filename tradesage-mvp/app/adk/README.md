# Core Agent Framework (OpenAI News Lab)

This directory contains the core agent framework for advanced news and market data analysis. The current agent set includes:

- AnomalyDetector: Detects unusual patterns in market data.
- NewsSummarizer: Summarizes news articles.
- DiversityAnalyzer: Analyzes diversity of news sources.
- BreakingNewsAlert: Flags breaking news articles.
- BiasDetector: Detects potential bias in news coverage.
- NewsQAAgent: Answers questions from the news corpus.

To add a new agent, create a new Python file in `agents/` and integrate it in `orchestrator.py`.
